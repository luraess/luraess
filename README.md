### Hi, I'm Ludovic

computational geoscientist at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/gse/home/menuinst/faculte/english.html) and lecturer at the [ETH Zurich Glaciology lab](https://vaw.ethz.ch/en/research/glaciology.html). I have a strong interest in high-performance computing (HPC) and the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate computations. GPUs and supercomputers permit the investigation of previously unsolvable problems at unprecedented resolutions. My research interests aim at better understanding spontaneous localisation of flow in deforming porous media and ice dynamics. On the technical aspects, I explore and develop portable and backend agnostic HPC software and tools.

I am a co-PI in the [GPU4GEO]() PASC project, developing _Frontier GPU multi-physics solvers_ and PI of the EuroHPC [STREAM](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/access-our-supercomputers/awarded-projects/spontaneous-rearrangment-ice-motion-stream_en) project to unveil _what mechanisms control the spontaneous rearrangement of ice motion in ice sheets?_.

I also designed and launched the [Solving partial differential equations in parallel on GPUs](https://pde-on-gpu.vaw.ethz.ch) course at ETH Zurich, democratising HPC GPU computing and software engineering skills in natural science and engineering studies using the Julia language.

I am also contributing to the [Julia language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/) open-source project, mostly for scientific computing in the [JuliaGPU](https://github.com/JuliaGPU) and [JuliaParallel](https://github.com/JuliaParallel) projects.
