### Welcome!

I am a computational geoscientist at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/gse/home/menuinst/faculte/english.html) and a lecturer at the [ETH Zurich Glaciology lab](https://vaw.ethz.ch/en/research/glaciology.html). My research lies at the intersection of high-performance computing (HPC), geophysics, and applied mathematics, with a strong focus on leveraging graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate scientific computing. By harnessing GPUs and supercomputers, I aim to tackle previously unsolvable problems at unprecedented resolutions.

My work centers on understanding spontaneous flow localisation in deforming porous media and ice dynamics. From a technical perspective, I develop portable, backend-agnostic HPC software and tools, enabling scalable simulations across diverse computing architectures.

#### Research & Initiatives

I lead the [GPU4GEO initiative](https://GPU4GEO.org), which focuses on developing **frontier GPU-based multi-physics solvers**. Recently, my research has expanded into **differentiable modeling and large-scale optimisation**, where we are pioneering differentiable multi-physics solvers for extreme-scale geophysical simulations using the [Julia language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/). Our contributions integrate with the broader **Julia open-source ecosystem**, particularly in [JuliaGPU](https://github.com/JuliaGPU) and [JuliaParallel](https://github.com/JuliaParallel).

#### Teaching & Outreach

As part of my commitment to **democratising HPC and GPU supercomputing**, I designed and launched the [Solving partial differential equations in parallel on GPUs](https://pde-on-gpu.vaw.ethz.ch) course at ETH Zurich. This course equips students in natural sciences and engineering with hands-on experience in HPC, GPU programming, and software engineering using Julia.
